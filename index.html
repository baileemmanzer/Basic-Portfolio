        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am a passionate Social Media Specialist with a diversified background in content creation, digital marketing, and website development and design. A proactive leader, proven to show resilience amidst adversity while innovating communication concepts.</p>
        <p>I love live music, being active and photography. I am a huge live music fanatic and volunteer for Sofar Sounds in Denver. I have played lacrosse since I was about 8 years old and have played floor hockey recreationally for the past two years and LOVE it. I have recently been practicing my digital photography on the side and enjoy portrait photography the most!</p>
